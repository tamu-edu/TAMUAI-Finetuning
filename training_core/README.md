# Private Training Core

This directory is intended for private training core implementations. The actual training logic is not included in this public repository for security and intellectual property reasons.

## Structure

The training core should include the following components:

- `ssl_training_core.py`: Self-supervised learning training implementation
- `sl_training_core.py`: Supervised learning training implementation

## Building Your Own Training Core

To use this finetuning framework, you need to implement your own training core with the following components:

### Self-supervised Learning Core
- Implement `train_model(resume_checkpoint=None, num_epochs=10)` function
- Handle model checkpointing and resumption
- Manage data preprocessing and tokenization
- Configure training parameters

### Supervised Learning Core
- Implement `train_qa_model(resume_checkpoint=None, num_epochs=10)` function
- Process QA pairs data
- Handle model training and evaluation
- Manage checkpoints and model saving

### Required Dependencies
- transformers
- torch
- datasets
- google-cloud-storage
- coiled

## Note

The actual implementation details of the training core are proprietary and not included in this public repository. Please refer to the documentation or contact the maintainers for access to the private training core.
